/**
 * What counts as a view worth paying for, and what that view is worth.
 *
 * This file is the anti-fraud mechanic, and it is deliberately **not fraud
 * detection**. We do not try to identify a bot ring — a platform with a fraud
 * team and full telemetry is better placed to do that than we are, and every
 * public account of this problem is a story about someone losing that arms
 * race. We change what is being bought instead.
 *
 * **A view is payable once it has survived.** Take the count now, take the
 * count from at least `dwellMs` ago, and pay against the smaller of the two:
 *
 *   - views still climbing  -> the older, smaller number wins, so nothing is
 *     paid for until it has had time to stick
 *   - views scrubbed by the platform between snapshots -> the newer, smaller
 *     number wins, so inflation that got removed is never paid for
 *
 * The asymmetry is the point. Inflating a count costs an attacker nothing;
 * keeping it inflated through the platform's own retro-scrubbing for a full day
 * is a materially harder problem, and it is the platform's fraud team doing
 * that work rather than ours. Whop arrived at a 24h payout delay empirically
 * after a botting scandal; this is the same delay derived from what it is
 * actually for.
 *
 * The corollary, made explicit because it is a design decision and not an
 * oversight: **there is no clawback.** Falling views reduce the *next* payout,
 * possibly to nothing, but never produce a negative one. Money that has
 * settled on-chain cannot be recalled, so a system that pretends otherwise is
 * lying about its own guarantees.

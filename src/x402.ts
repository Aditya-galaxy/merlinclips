/**
 * The receiving half — our service as an x402 storefront.
 *
 * Circle's prize is for agents *"autonomously making **or receiving**
 * payments as a core part of their business"*, and until now we only built the
 * making half. An agent that buys its inputs and is paid by a human with a
 * credit card is half an agent business; one that is *itself* an x402 endpoint
 * can be discovered and paid by another agent, with no human on either side.
 *
 * That completes the loop the whole system is about:
 *
 *   another agent ──402 pays──►  our research agent  ──402 pays──► data seller
 *                                (governed by mandates)
 *
 * The same protocol, both directions. Revenue in USDC, cost of goods in USDC,
 * and a margin that is arithmetic rather than a projection.
 *
 * x402 is deliberately simple, which is why it works for machines: an
 * unauthenticated request gets `402 Payment Required` plus a JSON body
 * describing exactly what to pay and where. The client signs a payment
 * authorization, retries with an `X-PAYMENT` header, and the server verifies
 * and serves. No account, no checkout page, no session — none of which a
 * machine has any use for.

/**
 * The service we sell to other agents.
 *
 * *Given a post URL and a brief: does this clip qualify, and how many of its
 * views have survived?*
 *
 * This is the payout engine's core competence, extracted and priced. Any
 * agent running creator campaigns needs exactly this call, and it is the
 * honest thing to list in Circle's marketplace — unlike the generic research
 * endpoint that shipped with the previous product and now has nothing to do
 * with what this repo builds.
 *
 * **The dwell answer requires history, and one call has none.** A stranger's
 * URL arriving for the first time has no yesterday to compare against, so the
 * first call cannot report surviving views and must not pretend to. Instead it
 * *starts the clock*: the count is recorded, and a later call reports what
 * survived between them. That is a real product shape rather than an apology —
 * a buying agent polls, and the answer sharpens.
 *
 * Every field that cannot be answered comes back explicitly null with a
 * reason. A verification service that fabricates the number it exists to
 * report is worse than one that says it does not know yet.

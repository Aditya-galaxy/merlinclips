# Merlin Clips

**You never pay for views that didn't survive.**

An autonomous agent that runs creator marketing campaigns end to end — reads the brief, judges each submitted clip against it, pulls real view counts, and settles in USDC under a ceiling it cannot raise.

Built on [Circle's Agent Stack](https://agents.circle.com/) for the **Build with Gemini XPRIZE** — category *Money & Financial Access*, opted in to the **Circle Agentic Economy Prize**.

---

## The problem

Brands pay creators per 1,000 views to clip and post their content. It is a real market: Content Rewards alone pays **over $40,000/day across ~1M videos a month** (Forbes, Apr 2026), for clients including Polymarket and ElevenLabs, and Whop settles roughly **$3B/year** in creator payouts.

It is also being drained. One brand documented paying **$1,500 for ~845,000 views that were "99.999% bot views"**. Multiple brands independently report view counts **clustering exactly at the maximum-payout cap** — not a coincidence, a calibrated attack.

The reason they lose the money is narrower than "fraud is hard":

> *"By the time a botted clip is caught, they have already paid for the views."*

**Payment happens before detection does.** That ordering is the whole bug.

## The mechanic

We do not try to out-detect a fraud ring. A platform with a fraud team and full telemetry is better placed to do that than we are, and every public account of this problem is a story about someone losing that arms race.

We changed what is being bought instead. **A view is payable once it has survived.**

```
confirmed = min(views_now, views_at_least_24h_ago)
payable   = confirmed − already_paid_for
amount    = payable × cpm ÷ 1000
```

- **Views still climbing** — the older, smaller number wins, so nothing pays until it sticks.
- **Views scrubbed by the platform** — the newer, smaller number wins, so inflation that got removed is never paid for.

The asymmetry is the point. Inflating a count costs an attacker nothing; keeping it inflated through the platform's own retro-scrubbing for a full day is materially harder — and it is the platform's fraud team doing that work, not ours.

**There is no clawback**, deliberately. Settled USDC cannot be recalled, so a falling count reduces the *next* payout to zero rather than pretending to reverse one. A system that claims otherwise is lying about its own guarantees.

## Why this is an agent, not a cron job

Three decisions require judgment, and each is gated:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Brief comprehension** | Gemini watches the clip and decides whether it satisfies a brief written in natural language. No rule expresses "does this show the product". |
| **Rate allocation** | The agent moves the CPM as the pool drains — but only inside a band the operator set. Out-of-band proposals are **refused, not clamped**: clamping would hand a prompt-injected agent the operator's ceiling, making overreach pay. |
| **Fraud investigation** | On anomalous view velocity the agent pulls more data before deciding. The investigation, not the threshold, is the agency. |

Underneath all three: **the model proposes, the engine disposes.** The agent can decide to pay $50. It cannot decide to pay $50 when the mandate says $10. A verdict is a *precondition* for payment, never a cause of it — and `PaymentIntent` structurally cannot express a disposition, with a test asserting no such field ever appears.

## The gate

Campaign checks run first, then delegate to a payment engine that is deterministic, first-match-wins, and fails closed.

| # | Check | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unknown submission / campaign / creator | `blocked` |
| 2 | Past the agreed settlement deadline | `blocked` |
| 3 | No verdict, or the verdict failed | `blocked` |
| 4 | Nothing has survived the dwell period yet | `held` |
| 5 | No views beyond what was already paid | `no_op` |
| 6 | Would exceed the campaign pool | `blocked` |
| 7 | Over this creator's cap | `requires_approval` |
| 8 | → absolute cap · mandate · mandate cap · rolling window | |

Two choices worth explaining:

**The pool blocks rather than escalating.** Every other cap routes to a human, because a wrongly-held payment costs attention and a wrongly-sent one is irreversible. The pool is different in kind — "ask a human to approve exceeding the budget" is how a budget stops being one.

**The rolling window is a velocity limiter.** It bounds USDC per hour independently of pool size, so a compromised agent holding entirely valid mandates still cannot empty a large pool in an afternoon.

No LLM sits in this path. No network call. No configurable strictness. An agent that can be talked into *proposing* a payment is expected and survivable; an engine that can be talked into *approving* one is not.

## Terms are bilateral

Every control above protects the brand from the agent. Exactly one thing protects the **creator from the brand**, and without it this system reproduces the complaint it was built to answer — *"generating genuine views, and never being paid."*

Accepting a clip **copies** the campaign's rate, dwell and per-creator cap onto the submission. The payout path then reads those terms, never the live campaign. A brand may pause or end a campaign — that refuses *new* clips, at acceptance, before a creator has spent any effort. It does not abandon work already taken. The obligation ends at a settlement deadline, not at the brand's discretion.

What this cannot do is conjure money. If the pool empties, it empties — which is why **the remaining pool is published before a creator invests effort**. Disclosure is the honest control, not a promise we cannot keep. It is also the one thing a fiat rail structurally cannot offer.

## Where the money moves

```
brand's agent --x402/nanopayments--> our agent --wallet transfer--> creators
```

Nanopayments is right for the **revenue** leg: our own service is 402-paywalled, so a buying agent pays it in a single request/response cycle. It is *not* the payout rail — `circle gateway` exposes only `balance`, `deposit` and `withdraw`, and a Gateway balance is spent by `circle services pay <url>` against x402 endpoints. A creator is a person with a wallet address, not an x402 seller.

Payouts settle over `circle wallet transfer`. Two flags do real work: `--idempotency-key` receives the deterministic intent id `pay-<submission>-<views>`, which closes the crash-between-settling-and-persisting window; `--estimate` is what dry-run uses, so a dry run exercises the real CLI, wallet and chain and stops short of broadcasting.

## What we sell to other agents

The engine's core competence, extracted and priced in three tiers:

| Endpoint | Price | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/verify/preview` | **free** | Can you handle this link, are you already watching it, when will a real answer exist? |
| `POST /api/views` | 0.005 USDC | Latest and surviving view counts. No verdict. |
| `POST /api/verify` | 0.05 USDC | All of the above, plus *does this clip meet the brief?* |

x402 throughout — **no account, no API key, no card on file.**

The free tier is deliberate and it deliberately omits the numbers. It tells a buying agent everything needed to *plan* a call and nothing it could use *instead of* one. The larger sellers in Circle's marketplace all list free routes for the same reason: an agent has to be able to discover you and confirm you work before it will spend anything.

The price gap is honest rather than promotional — `/api/views` is a tenth of `/api/verify` because no model runs, and charging the same for both would be charging for work we didn't do.

**The first call on a post starts the clock.** A post seen for the first time has no yesterday to compare against, so `views.confirmed` comes back `null` with a stated reason rather than a plausible-looking zero — call again after the dwell window and the surviving figure is there. Every field that cannot be answered is `null` with a reason. A verification service that fabricates the number it exists to report is worse than one that admits it doesn't know yet.

The machine-readable contract is [openapi.json](openapi.json), served at `/openapi.json`. Circle's marketplace requires one so a *buying* agent can read the inputs and outputs itself instead of being told about them by a human.

**On the Agent Marketplace:** we do not buy from it — 958 listings but 22 providers, three of which are 60% of the catalogue, against roughly $28K/day of x402 volume that is about half wash trading. We do intend to **sell** into it. Those are different questions, and conflating them is a mistake we made once.

## Status

```

**Scope, stated plainly.** YouTube and X only — Instagram, Facebook and TikTok need Meta/TikTok app review, which runs 2–6 weeks. We do not claim to detect bots better than anyone; we bound the damage and make every decision auditable. Payouts at scale are regulated, and this operates at demo scale.

## Pre-existing work, disclosed

Per the competition's *New Projects Only* requirement:

- **This project was created on 2026-08-04**, inside the submission period. Every line of source here is new.
- **[Circle Agent Stack starter kits](https://github.com/circlefin/agent-stack-starter-kits)** (Apache-2.0) — we build on the `google-adk` kit's tool definitions and its `ApprovalFn` seam. We replace its terminal-prompt approval implementation; we do not vendor its code.
- **[Merlin Clips](https://github.com/Aditya-galaxy/Merlin Clips)**, by the same author, is a cloud threat-defense platform with an earn-trust governance model for autonomous containment actions. **Its design informed this project** — the fail-closed policy ordering, expiring delegated authority, and hash-chained audit. **No code was copied**; this is an independent implementation in a different language for a different domain (irreversible payments rather than reversible containment).

# Merlin Clips — container for Google Cloud Run.
#
# Two competition requirements meet here: the base rules require the project to
# run on Google Cloud Platform, and judges must be able to reach a working
# instance "free of charge and without any restriction" until judging ends.
#
# Deliberately minimal. A judge's session must not be able to fail on a build
# step, and the fewer moving parts between them and the demo, the fewer ways
# that happens. There is no bundler, no transpile step and no node_modules in
# the final image: Bun runs the TypeScript directly, and the app's runtime
# dependency list is empty by design.

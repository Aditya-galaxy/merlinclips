 * carries no authority; a `Snapshot` is a fact retrieved from a platform API,
 * never from the creator; a `Payout` exists only downstream of a deterministic
 * decision.
 *
 * The one field worth pausing on is `dwellMs`. Views are not paid for when
 * they appear — they are paid for when they have *survived*. See `views.ts`.

/**
 * The payout gate — between "the agent thinks this clip earned something" and
 * "USDC left the campaign wallet".
 *
 * This composes with `PaymentPolicyEngine` rather than replacing or modifying
 * it. The money controls that engine enforces — the absolute ceiling, the
 * mandate, the mandate cap, the rolling window — are already property-tested
 * and are not touched here. What this file adds are the checks that only make
 * sense for a campaign, and it runs them *first*, so a submission that has no
 * business being paid never reaches the payment path at all.
 *
 * Order of evaluation, first match wins:
 *
 *   1. Unknown submission / campaign / creator   -> blocked
 *   2. Past the agreed settlement deadline       -> blocked
 *   3. No verdict, or the verdict failed         -> blocked
 *   4. Nothing has survived the dwell period yet -> held
 *   5. No views beyond what was already paid     -> no_op
 *   6. Would exceed the campaign pool            -> blocked
 *   7. Over this creator's cap for the campaign  -> requires_approval
 *   8. -> PaymentPolicyEngine.decide()
 *
 * **The live campaign is not consulted for an accepted clip.** Rate, dwell and
 * per-creator cap all come from `submission.acceptedTerms`, frozen when the
 * clip was taken in. A brand may pause or end a campaign — that refuses *new*
 * work, at `acceptSubmission`, before a creator has spent any effort. It does
 * not abandon work already accepted. Without this the system reproduces the
 * complaint it was built to answer.
 *
 * Three of these deserve a note.
 *
 * **The pool check blocks rather than escalating.** Every other cap in this
 * system routes to a human, because a wrongly-held payment costs attention and
 * a wrongly-sent one is irreversible. The pool is different in kind: it is not
 * a risk threshold but the total the operator funded, and "ask a human to
 * approve exceeding the budget" is how a budget stops being one. Raising it
 * means funding more, which is a deliberate act on a different code path.
 *
 * **The rolling window is doing new work here.** It was written to stop a
 * thousand small payments draining a wallet. In a campaign it is the velocity
 * limiter: it bounds USDC per hour independently of how large the pool is, so
 * a compromised agent holding entirely valid mandates still cannot empty a
 * $5,000 pool in an afternoon.
